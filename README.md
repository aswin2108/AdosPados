## Inspiration

The inefficiency of the current method of distribution of news and other information was the inspiration. Currently, the news is distributed through WhatsApp groups where these messages would get lost in other messages like social media posts, memes, etc, most of the time people miss this news which creates other problems.

## What it does

Ados-Pados is a Hindi word for Neighborhood!
It gives the opportunity to spread the news in the form of posts, you will be able to post different types of posts, and the color is decided based on that for easiness. Here you can find out what's happening around your neighborhood. You can post and get part-time jobs in your neighborhood. Just think you have something which you don't need but you think could be useful for others, just post it and interested people would approach you.
It gives an online platform to the nearby shops where they would provide their WhatsApp number and people could order it through WhatsApp and the goods would be at your doorstep.

## How we built it

I built it using :

- React
- Firebase
- Javascript

## Local Setup

Step 1: Clone the forked repo.
Step 2: Run `npm install` to install all the packages.
Step 3: Run `npm start` the app would be running in [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Challenges we ran into

Adding the data with and without images, and different colors for the posts was a challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Really proud of pulling this off in this very short time

## What we learned

This helped me to get a better understanding of react and firebase.

## What's next for Ados-Pados

Filtering out the posts using dates, self-expiring posts, and placing orders to shops in a better way is in the planning.
